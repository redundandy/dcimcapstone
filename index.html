        <h1>"How Secure Are We Really?"</h1>
        <h2>A Look at How Cybersecurity Tools Are Marketed and Understood by Everyday Users</h2>
        <p>Andy Nguyen's DCIM Capstone Project</p>
        <h3>An Introduction</h3>
        <p>Picture this: after installing a free VPN app with glowing five-star reviews and a promise of ‚Äúcomplete anonymity,‚Äù someone starts browsing freely on public Wi-Fi, convinced they‚Äôre totally secure. The app said it had ‚Äúmilitary-grade encryption,‚Äù so what could go wrong?</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity tools like VPNs and antivirus software are widely advertised and used nowadays helping the average consumer protect themselves from cybersecurity threats. However, the way these tools are marketed and perceived can lead to misunderstandings, and sometimes a false sense of security. Understanding how these tools actually work is essential for making the most of them.</p>

    <h3>Some Common Consumer Cybersecurity Tools and How They Actually Work</h3>
    <h4>VPNs</h4>
    <p>You've probably heard about VPNs, they are widely used nowadays. In 2025, CNET found that 47% of adults in the US use a VPN.</p>
    <img src="cnet.png" alt="screenshot from https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/vpn-survey-2025/" />

      <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/vpn-survey-2025/" target="_blank">CNET</a>
    </p>
    <p>When you connect to a VPN, your device and the VPN server quickly perform a "handshake" to exchange encryption keys, 
      ensuring only they can decrypt each other‚Äôs data. This creates a secure tunnel through which your encrypted data travels to the VPN server, 
      where it is decrypted and sent to the website you're visiting. The website's response is then encrypted again by the VPN server and sent back through the tunnel to your device, 
      where it's finally decrypted. As a result, anyone trying to monitor your activity will only see encrypted, unreadable information 
      (<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-is-a-vpn/" target="_blank">Tomaschek & Long, 2024</a>).
    </p>
    <p>It is important to note that ‚Äúwhile using a VPN means all that information is hidden from your ISP, the VPN provider can see it all instead 
      ‚Ä¶[and it is] hard to judge how well any of the hundreds of VPNs on the market take care of your data,‚Äù 
      (<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-is-a-vpn/" target="_blank">Grauer, 2021</a>).</p>

    <h4>Antivirus Software</h4>
    <p>You may have heard of Norton or McAfee. ‚ÄúAntivirus software scans files or your computer‚Äôs memory for certain patterns that may indicate the presence of malicious software (i.e., malware). 
      Anti-virus software (sometimes more broadly referred to as anti-malware software) looks for patterns based on the signatures or definitions of known malware.‚Äù 
      (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-anti-virus-software" target="_blank">CISA, 2019</a>)</p>
    <p>Sometimes, zero-day exploits can slip past traditional antivirus tools. ‚ÄúThe zero-day exploits used in these attacks are unknown to antivirus companies by definition.‚Äù

    <h3>A Brief Case Study</h3>
    <p>A field study was conducted of over a hundred thousand problem descriptions that was sent to the customer support department of an organization that provides antivirus software. 
      They compared user diagnoses of the problem to what experts believed the problems were. 
      In the end, the article concluded, "we found that users and experts agreed for most types of issues, except for attacks (e.g., malware infections). 
      The disagreements, however, uncovered several misconceptions that may expose users to risks 
      (e.g., falling victim to technical support and fake AV scams),‚Äù

    </p>
    <p>This paper highlights a disconnect between how individuals perceive cybersecurity and how security technologies actually function. 
      It also points out that adding a security tool can sometimes lead users to engage in riskier behavior than they normally would, 
      ultimately making the technology more harmful than helpful.

    <h3>How These Tools Are Marketed</h3>
    <p>Influencer VPN ads on platforms like YouTube often present themselves as educational, but they frequently blur the line between marketing and misinformation. 
      Some VPN ads make exaggerated claims, even suggesting that with a VPN, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt ever have to worry about anything on the internet again.‚Äù
      (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13017" target="_blank">Akgul et al., 2024</a>)
    </p>
    <p>You've probably have heard NordVPN. If not you should watch the video below.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUEoncwf4K0?si=Li-VjgKT1u1sI9_G" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Notice that they say you can "switch off" trackers and viruses with the use of their VPN.</p>
    <p>Ever heard of Kaspersky? While I was browsing their website I got an ad from them. Below is a screenshot of one of their ads while I browsing one of 
      <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/antivirus-software-how-to-choose" target="_blank">Kaspersky's sites.</a></p>
    <img src="kasperskyad.png" alt="kasperskyad" />
    <p>Notice that they say you can get "complete" digital protection.</p>
    <p>Although these security products have the potential to provide value to their users, the way that they are marketed can cause misinterpretation.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>The Unintended Consequences</h3>
    <p>Influencer marketing has turned VPNs into trendy must-haves, often pitched as simple fixes for online privacy. 
      You‚Äôve probably heard a YouTuber or podcaster say something like, ‚ÄúJust install this VPN, and you'll keep your privacy.‚Äù,
      But here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs not that simple. These ads rarely mention the technical know-how needed to actually use a VPN safely. 
      It was noted that ‚Äúeven in 2018, using a VPN ‚Äòsafely‚Äô remains a task mostly beyond the amateur user, and no VPN, at least that we were able to find, is perfect.‚Äù
      (<a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10100952" target="_blank">Khan et al., 2018</a>)
    </p>
    <p>This confusion isn't new, VPNs are still widely misunderstood by the average consumer, 
      often being treated as all encompassing privacy solutions without users really knowing how they work.

    <h3>What Can We Do?</h3>
    <p>To stay truly protected, consumers need to go beyond flashy ads and develop a basic understanding of how cybersecurity tools actually work. 
      This means doing a bit of research before trusting bold claims and recognizing that no tool is foolproof. 
      I would recommend users to look for transparency in a provider‚Äôs privacy policy, read independent reviews from trusted sources, 
      and understand their own security habits in relation to the tools. </p>
